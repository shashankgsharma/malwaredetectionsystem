<h3>Deployed project link: <a href = "http://ec2-13-239-47-93.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/" target = "_blank">malwaredetectionsystem.project</a></h3>
<ol>
  <li>This is a group project comprises of sevral modules/ phases, where the main goal will be to detect the malware files, running on a virtual system.</li>
  <li>working: <ol><li>User runs app.py</li><li>User uploads behavioral log file with malware top 100 api-calls</li><li>User gets the number of malware and benign files as a result in tabular form.</li></ol></li>
  <li>The training and testing data is obtained from kaggle, which includes the 'hash files' vs 'top-100-sequential-api-calls-made-by-malware'.</li>
  <li>This project uses ML and DL algorithms and techniques, to predict the files as malware/ non-malware.</li>
  <li>The Deployment part is done using fastapi.</li>
  <li>The model is deployed on server side using pkl format</li>
  <li>The client html side recieves the predicted results through ajax requests.</li>
  <li>Traditional ML algos: Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, Linear Regression.</li>
  <li>Deep Learning algo include: Sequential MLP.</li>
  <li>The deployed model is XGBoost.</li>
  <li>Significant help of Chatgpt was also taken for debugging and deployment purposes.</li>
  <li>Deployment tool used: Amazon AWS EC2, VM = Ubuntu.</li>
  <li>This project is inspired from the CUCKOO SANDBOX malware detection technique.</li>
